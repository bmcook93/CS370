CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS

  The code in this project was meant to train an AI algorithm that would solve the "treasure hunt game," where an actor has to determine the quickest path through the maze to a goal. The code initializing the network and running the training events were already provided, and my part of this project was to develop the Q-Training algorithm that effectively trained the model. This course taught many things about the workings of AI and the multitude of ways that it can be used to streamline processes and promote innovation in the world. This is the goal of computer scientists - to research ways where technology will benefit society and promote innovation and growth. Developing and applying tools can help many fields, like healthcare, grow and find new ways to perform tasks. Approaching problems as a computer scientist is the same. By looking at a problem and wondering how I can automate or use technology to make the processes easier, I am innovating, building tools that assist in making difficult processes easier. Ethical concerns are always at the heart of decision making. For AI, these ethical concerns are, in my opinion, nearly always attributed to privacy and compliance with laws. Protecting personal data of consumers is priority number one.
